# SUPER-MARCHE-
I have implemented an interactive supermarket scenario. Assuming the supermarket has only the following 10 items and each item belongs to one of the three categories: Apparels, Electronics or Eatables. The general flow of the program looks something like this: 1. Greet the customer and inform them about the available items 2. Decide the type of order (bulk or regular) 3. Take the order 4. Print the order summary 5. Print the category-wise cost 6. Print the discount details 7. Print the tax details 8. Ask the user for coupon (if any) 9. Print final costs 10. Say goodbye! Don’t worry, we’ll discuss each step in detail :) 1 Item Co
